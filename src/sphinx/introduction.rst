Introduction
============

Fj√•ge provides a **lightweight** and **easy-to-learn** platform for `agent-oriented software development <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-oriented_programming>`_ in Java and Groovy. 

Although most of the functionality of the framework can be used in pure-Java projects, the adoption of Groovy in the project simplifies development immensely. In this guide, most of the code examples are in Groovy. Writing equivalent Java code is mostly trivial, though there are cases where the mapping may not be obvious. Developers wishing to develop Java agents are advised to read the chapter ":ref:`java`".
