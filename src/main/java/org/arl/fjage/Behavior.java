 * <li>{@link CyclicBehavior} for continuous behaviors
 * <li>{@link OneShotBehavior} for one time behaviors
 * <li>{@link WakerBehavior} for behaviors to be executed once after a specified period
 * <li>{@link TickerBehavior} for behaviors to be executed periodically
 * <li>{@link PoissonBehavior} for simulating Poisson arrival processes
 * <li>{@link MessageBehavior} for behaviors to process incoming messages
 * <li>{@link TestBehavior} for unit testing
 * <li>{@link FSMBehavior} for implementing finite state machines
 * </ul>
 * Additionally, developers may create their own behaviors by extending this class or one
